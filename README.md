# Color_recognition
In the current setup, our color recognition process involves utilizing an image as input and executing our code to detect colors. We also rely on a CSV file containing a color list, which aids us in determining the recognized colors.

To execute the code effectively, follow these steps:

Download the Python code and ensure you have the required libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, and OpenCV.
Download both the target image and the provided dataset.
For the image.py script, please follow these instructions:

Download the complete src files.
Install PIP, if not already installed.
Install the necessary libraries: matplotlib and scipy.
Run the code using your Python interpreter to observe the outcomes.
By refining this process, you'll be able to enhance your color recognition workflow and achieve accurate results. If you encounter any issues or require further assistance, feel free to reach out.
